Thanks to the many people who have supported and encouraged me on this long
academic journey, especially my Graduate Advisor and Committee Chair, Dr. Chris
Papachristou.

Dr. Francis Wolff has been instrumental in helping me to achieve this milestone.
Frank has spent countless hours collaborating, coaching, and teaching me to be a
better engineer since my first undergraduate computer architecture course in the
spring semester of 2000.

I also want to thank my managers and leaders at work over the many years for
their support, encouragement, and understanding of my educational endeavors
while I was working for them.

Thanks to Dr. Alexander Cherpakov, Dr. Dukki Chung, and Mr. Rahul Sharma for
reviewing and helping to make this dissertation better through your valuable
suggestions.

I owe so much to my family for their love, help, patience, and understanding in
my educational pursuits.
